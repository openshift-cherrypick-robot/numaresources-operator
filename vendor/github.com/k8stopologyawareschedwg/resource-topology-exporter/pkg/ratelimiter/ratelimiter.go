// The ratelimiter is a kind of man-in-the-middle.
// It provides an input interface with a channel for a writter to send events at any rate
// and an output interface with another channel where a reader will receive events at a configured rate
// At the input interface the main goals are:
// - writer should not block at all or tha minimum time possible.
// - If there is no more room for events in the "bucket" the write should not block at all but "fail" silently.
// At the output interface the reader should get the events not faster than the configured rate, blocking if there is no event to read.
